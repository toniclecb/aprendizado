Scrum:

basics:
based on value, how to organize around it

sprint -> valuable product delivery -> fully functional
PO -> user stories
retrospective review - team 'how perform better?'

**product owner**: responsible for the direction the team is heading. The PO owns the relationship with the stakeholders.
They also create the roadmap and MVP.
manage the backlog, the stories in highest priority need the right amount of details
PO is meeting with individual stakeholders quite frequently
The PO's focus is understanding, defining, negotiating, and influencing.

**scrum master**: focused in the team, Scrum masters are the guardians of the scrum framework. They ensure that the team stays within the guardrails of scrum. They facilitate the scrum meetings, also known as ceremonies.
ensure the team health is protected by limiting distractions and keeping the team from over-committing.
The Scrum Master is also saying that the team needs to focus on improving their performance as a team, not improving the product

Think of the Scrum Master and PO as being the two opposing forces that keep the team in balance.

**product vision**:
An effective way to engage others in helping define a vision is to include them when setting it. When you hold a visioning session, your PO will need to invite the executive sponsor, all the key stakeholders, and everyone on the team.
Coming out of this session, the team and stakeholders will have taken the first essential step in moving from idea to execution. They'll have aligned themselves behind a vision that they have helped to define.

**Vision to roadmap**:
For this meeting, you'll need the product owner, Scrum masters and all the team members. It's ideal if you can also include subject matter experts and key stakeholders.
One key thing to remember here is that your theme priorities may not be linear.
One key thing to remember about the roadmap is that it's only an estimate. 

**Advanced story writing tips**
stories that are developed early on are large and often lack details. These are known as epic stories or epics.
the epics are decomposed to the right user stories
Remember that user stories should follow the INVEST acronym, meaning that they are independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, and testable.
One technique that you can use to help guide your story writing is function-based analysis ... The simplest steps to use are create, read, update, and delete.
Another technique you can use to break down your stories are the steps in a process... Each one of these steps can be a user story because each one can deliver value on its own.

**Detailed release planning**
an estimate of when functionality will be delivered. When you host this meeting, you'll need the PO, Scrum master and the whole team to attend. 
You're only release planning the next three to six months.
Going into this meeting, you'll need to know your sprint length, your prioritized and estimated backlog and your real or projected velocity.
There are two ways you can plan your releases, by schedule or by functionality.

**Continual backlog refinement**
One of the PO's critical responsibilities is to keep the product backlog up-to-date so there are solid stories for the team to use during sprint planning.
The backlog grooming meeting, however, is really intended for a subset of the team, the PO, scrum master, subject matter expert, and technical expert to write news stories, remove stories or groom them by rewording or re-prioritizing.
During backlog grooming, the PO states their goal for the sprint.
The team reviews each story, having a conversation about its details and collectively confirming what the definition of done will be for that story.
as a result of the ceremony, the backlog is updated and both the release plan and roadmap are adjusted
Backlog Refinement held in the middle of the sprint - so the PO has time to get answers for the team

**Introduction to servant leadership**
Servant leadership is a philosophy that focuses on ensuring that other people's highest priority needs are met first.
In leadership, the focus is providing guidance and direction.
Servant leaders believe people everywhere want to contribute to a greater goal.

teams and the people on them need three things in order to be fully engaged in their work and thrive:
autonomy, which is simply the need for people to be self-directed. 
mastery, which is the inherent human desire to get better at what we do every day.
purpose, which means we believe we're working toward a greater good or an ideal

In agile and scrum, we focus on providing autonomy, mastery, and purpose to our teams. The way we do this is through servant leadership.
They communicate the vision and purpose and keep the team focused each sprint. And they remove obstacles so the team is free to master the work they're doing.
They do this using the soft skills of persuasion, empathy, listening, and negotiation.

**Manage team forming and storming stages**
As a leader, you need to hold one-on-one conversations with each team member. This is going to help you establish trusting relationships with them and set the foundation for future interactions. You're also facilitating conversations with the group that help team members get to know each other. 
you'll hold introductions, established team norms, and help the team define success for them.
Avoidance of conflict will hurt the team in the long run. So it's best to face challenges head on.
Finally, keep the team boundaries simple by first keeping the goals clearly in front of the team. Next, using the team norms as the guide for daily interactions. And finally, using success measures to maintain focus on working together.

**Take the team from norming to performing**
At this stage, the resolution of conflicts during the storming phase have resulted in a greater sense of intimacy and trust among the team members.
The norming stage can be identified when you see that everyone on the team is taking personal responsibility for their work and their interactions with each other.
As the leader of a norming team, your focus shifts to guiding them toward improvement.
And what else can we deliver to our customers that will truly delight them?
As the team emerges into high-performance mode, you can help them become servant leaders for other teams in the company.
You'll need to monitor the team as long as they're together, so you know what stage they're in.

**Remove impediments for the team**
Effectively removing these impediments does two things: first, it helps establish a trusting relationship between the team members and the scrum master; and second, it helps keep the team focused on the work.
When something is raised during the standup, the scrum master makes a note and the meeting continues as usual.
Depending on the impediment, this will simply be a matter of negotiation and compromise.
Helping team members see each other from a different perspective can resolve things too. Understanding and acceptance can go a long way to removing an impediment.

**Protect the team in scrum**
Like a police force of one, the scrum master must watch for signs of distractions and nip them in the bud to end the problems quickly in order to protect the team.
If the event is truly an emergency, and there's no other person or team to handle it, the scrum master and product owner need to examine the sprint commitment to see if any stories can be deferred to the next sprint. If this is a common occurrence for this team, the PO and scrum master can work together to hold back some team capacity from the commitment in the next sprint.
The team needs to be protected from outside distractions that keep them from delivering their commitments.

**Celebrate success on your scrum team**
Scrum is simple to execute, but really hard to master. So, be sure you're celebrating successes when you have them
Remember, purpose is a significant motivator for people ... what it feels like and how much fun it can be to win.
if you only recognize what needs to be improved, you lose sight of what you're already doing well.
Mastery is another significant motivator for people. We want to get better at what we're doing. When we celebrate our improvements, we gain confidence.
when you celebrate with your team, you're building a deeper connection with them on a more personal level.
In scrum, celebration is the broad term we use for recognizing an accomplishment no matter how small.
I've seen teams shake maracas or ring a bell every time a story gets to done on their board. Some teams use part of every retro congratulating one another on their biggest individual accomplishments for that sprint.


**Move toward high performance**

by working on your servant leadership skills. Practice asking questions and listening to what your team offers as solutions, instead of fixing things for them.
